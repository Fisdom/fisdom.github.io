For the purpose of this project we felt Facebook has too much control over the social lives of humanity and it is slowly destroying our core social fabric of human communication. We decided to create a chrome extension and app that would allow users to go on strike against facebook by disabling their access to their app or site and returning access after the strike is over. I'm really proud of this project because I got a lot of hands on experience writing, compiling, and deploying a solidity contract. My role included: </p>

Users would be able to view a thumbnail of the audio article, control the audio broadcast and read a brief description. The purpose of the application was so that users could control on demand their daily auditory news broadcast, by being able to pick and choose the topics they wished to listen to.
