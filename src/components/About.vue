        <p>Hi, my name is Fisnik Berisha and I have been in digital marketing for 5 years focusing mostly on Pay Per Click (PPC, Adwords, Bing Ads, Yahoo & Facebook Advertising) and Search Engine Optimization. I have worked in online marketing roles both client and agency side.</p>

        <p>Previously, I worked as a research scientist in Microbiology & Cell Science, which helped me develop a strong foundation for experimentation and data analysis that have helped me become good at digital marketing.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, I have many interests.  I enjoy traveling, trying new food, reading (mostly about psychology, philosophy, and technology).</p>
