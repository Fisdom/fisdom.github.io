      <p>Before I begin thanks for visiting my page.</p>
      <p>I've been working in the tech industry for about 5 years now, and have mainly focused on Front-End Development and anything user facing. I have always had a good sense of empathy and I translate it into my work to make technology more accesbile and enjoyable to the community.</p>
      <p>Since I was young I enjoyed playing with computers, and changing themes in Windows 98 plus. It was until I entered college that I was able to write my own code, and finally be able to create things. I was never that great at math, but luckily I found the digital media program at UCF which combined humanities with technology. I was a perfect fit. </p>
