        <p>Before I begin thanks for visiting my page.</p>
        <p>I've been working in the tech industry for about 5 years now, and have mainly focused on Front-End Development and anything user facing. I have always had a good sense of empathy and I translate it into my work to make technology more accesbile and enjoyable to the community.</p>
        <p>Since I was young I enjoyed playing with computers, and changing themes in Windows 98 plus. It was until I entered college that I was able to write my own code, and finally be able to create things. I was never that great at math, but luckily I found the digital media program at UCF which combined humanities with technology. I was a perfect fit. </p>
        <p> Just a couple of months before graduation I started to attend some tech meetups in Miami and at one of them I met my future employer for a startup, to build a Job Board. I found it to be a good opportunity to gain some real experience, and being able to learn from the trials and tribulations of building something from nothing.</p>
        <p>Fast Forward three year later, we built an additional 4 more apps which include, the jobboard, a resume builder, a legal document builder, and all kinds of lead generation mini apps. I learned a wealth of information on monetization of online applications, and what it means to move fast and break things. During this time I participated in many hackathons which include winning 2 of them and being a finalist for another.</p>
        <p>Currently I have been going down the rabbit whole of blockchain development, mainly the ethereum platform. I strongly beleive this technology will be embeded into our future. I had the pleasure to participate at both ETH Waterloo and ETH Denver and both times got to be a part of an amazing team. </p>
